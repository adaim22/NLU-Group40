Group40-ED Jupyter Notebook

**Overview**

This Jupyter Notebook is designed as a comprehensive guide for implementing and evaluating a machine learning model, specifically using Logistic Regression and a Deep Learning mode using a Bidirectional LSTM. The notebook includes sections on data preprocessing, model training, model prediction, and evaluation.

**Dependencies**

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas,
numpy,
sklearn,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
joblib

Make sure that you have the latest versions of these libraries installed, or install them using the following pip command:

pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn joblib

**Structure**

The notebook is divided into several sections, which are:

Data Preprocessing: This includes the preparation of text data for machine learning.<br>
Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression model once, and a Bidirectional-LSTM another time.<br>
Model Prediction: Making predictions using the trained model.<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using confusion matrix and other metrics.<br>
Saving the Model and Vectorizer: Instructions on how to save the trained models.<br>

**How to Use**

Load the Notebook: Open the Demo Code in your Jupyter environment.<br>
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries are installed.<br>
Download the Models: The Linear Regression model is already saved as lr_model.pkl. *However*, download the LSTM model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G9cDLSvNKo_a2TohnK9imuL_6aFgdhph?usp=sharing <br>
Run the Notebook: Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom to avoid runtime errors due to unmet dependencies between notebook cells. Place the correct file paths to run the model on the test files. More details in Group40-DemoCode.ipynb <br>
